# 🏦 Credit Card Fraud Detection
📘 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant financial problem worldwide. This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques.
The dataset used contains real-world anonymized transaction data, where each transaction is labeled as fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).

This project demonstrates the complete data science lifecycle — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.
# Objectives

Analyze and understand patterns in fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions
Build and compare multiple ML models for fraud detection
Handle imbalanced data using resampling techniques.
